# Introduction

# Version Notes

The version of this app currently uploaded is 0.0.01.  In cases where I update the README without any updates to the website itself I do not update the version number or use branches for my work.  Each version number will lack a commit number until the next version is uploaded.  The current commit number is always added retroactively.  In general, for version number format X.Y.Z:
* X: increases in this number represent a complete overhaul of some section of the website, source code, or UI
* Y: increases in this number represent a major functional change/aesthetic change or addition to the app
* Z: increases in this number represent changes that are relatively minor but still warrant a new commit

Versions prior to 1.0.0 are pre-deployment and will have varying levels of functionality.  If you are looking for a functioning version of the app be sure to fork from versions 1.0.0 and later.

# Future Plans

* *Important!* Before using CSS `:hover` to highlight squares which are available for selection I tried using event handlers `onmouseover` and on `mouseout`.  It was a nightmare.  *Do not* attempt to refactor in this way unless the refactor also involves implementing jQuery which handles these events more easily.
* Continue building out the `README.md`.
* Add `<header>` and `<footer>` elements.
* Render highlighting for the winning cells in

Although I'm always interested in meeting new collaborators I prefer to keep this an individual project as a skills demonstrator.
